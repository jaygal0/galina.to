I made it. I'm now officially in my mid-thirties. I'm closer to 40 now than 30. How do I feel about it?

I'm not sure.

A few years ago, I started writing a yearly post on my birthday to help me reflect on the year that has gone by. Before writing this post, I wanted to remind myself of what I wrote in previous years, so I read every entry.

It's interesting to see how much I've grown in such a short amount of time. I sometimes forget about the things that I have achieved. They say it's better to compare yourself to the person you were yesterday than to who someone else is today.

I totally agree.

This year has had its fair share of ups and downs, but when I look back at what I've achieved, the life I've experienced, and the things I have done, it reminds me that I'm still moving forward. I'm growing, and I'm where I want to be.

I've been trying to be more present, to enjoy the moment, and to not take a second for granted. But I don't want to forget where I've come from or the things I have achieved. These entries are a great reminder of this, and I hope to continue this tradition for as long as possible.

This year has seen growth across all the pillars of life (health, wealth, love, and happiness), and I'm glad that I can truly write this. I wouldn't want to excel in the pillar of wealth, only to have my health deteriorate right before my eyes. It's important to me that I maintain a sense of balance across all the pillars.

This is what I'm striving for and hope to maintain. Similar to the year that has gone by, it'll be a difficult balancing act, but it's important that I keep this as the focal point and find the right and healthy way to balance life.

I hope in a year's time, I read back at this and see that not only have I grown, but I've been able to achieve a sense of balance across all four pillars.
