Almost 2 weeks have passed and I've hardly done any work on my projects. I don't know what it is. Is it because the days are getting darker? Maybe I'm finding it difficult to balance life. Or perhaps I'm just plain lazy. I'm certain it's a culmination of all of the above.

At the same time, as I'm going through this period I don't feel as guilty as I used to. I would usually beat myself up about how "lazy" I am, and how I should pick up the slack and do something productive with my life. Perhaps this is a sign of growth, or maybe I'm making excuses.

Judging from the previous sentence, I guess I've not grown enough.

Since I've not been actively working on my projects, it has allowed me to sit with my thoughts and be a little more reflective. What have I discovered in this quiet period of self-reflection? I want to get back into the grind, I want to build something, and I want to know what it's like to be able to generate revenue from something that I've created.

I need to hold myself accountable but be okay if I falter. If it happens, it happens, but I need to be able to pick myself up again and build up the momentum.
This is why I've decided to journal this journey of mine and post it here, allowing for the rest of the world to join me.

Not that I expect there to be any interest from anyone who would want to read my posts, but knowing that it's live and out there lights a fire under me telling me that I need to keep going. That I need to keep pushing toward my dreams and that consistently working hard - and smart - will get me there.

I'm going to attempt to write one post a week. It could be outlining what I did for the week that helped me move towards my goals, it could be me writing down the many ideas that I have in my head, or it could be me telling myself to pick up the slack.

Whatever the subject matter, it may be a big ask, but I'm going to try and hold myself accountable.
