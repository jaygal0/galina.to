As I'm writing this I'm currently on a treadmill at my gym walking at a steady pace. Since I've [written a post on my phone before](https://www.galina.to/blog/sparking-creativity) I don't see why I can't do it again. This time it'll be with a little more movement.

I don't want to lose my streak of writing a weekly post so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone and write a post while I complete my zone 2 workout. Thankfully this kind of training is less strenuous so I can get away with being on my phone while on a treadmill.

It has been quite a hectic week. We had guests over, celebrated Christmas together, and played games until the early morning. My usual schedule was all over the place. I hardly worked out, hence me being on a treadmill right now.

I did however manage to sneak in a few hours of deep work this week. When I had some time to myself, my initial reaction was to play games on the Nintendo Switch. Then one sitting I thought to myself, "Shouldn't I be using my time more wisely? Especially since I don't have a lot of time to myself right now."

I'm unsure if feeling guilty about playing games and relaxing is a healthy way of thinking. After all, it was the festive holidays and I needed a little break. At the same time, I knew deep down that I wanted to work on my project.

So I got to work whenever I could.

With the little time that I had, I needed to focus on the most important task. I know my site is lacking content and not winning on the SEO front. I've been reading on how to improve it and using the advice to write targeted content.

Since I've built the site from scratch, this meant I also needed to figure out a system to easily maintain and upload new posts. No different to what I do for this site. After a few sittings in front of the computer I was able to sort it out.

This was a small feat, but an important one. I know that I'm going to be focusing on creating more content in the future so it was important to make sure I have an easy system to upload new content.

I'm thankful I got this done during such a busy period. At the same time I understand the importance of rest and I should be aware of when I'm pushing it a little too much. This time around I don't think I did, plus I really wanted to work on my project.

Since it has taken me around 45 minutes to write this first draft. It's probably a good idea that I jump off the treadmill and start the rest of my day.
