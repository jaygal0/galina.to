## Lead UX Designer for Volvo B2C Product

As the Lead UX Designer for a small team, I oversaw the development of a B2C product commissioned by Volvo. My responsibilities included ensuring adherence to Volvoâ€™s branding and guidelines while also making the app user-friendly and logistically sound.

Working closely with key stakeholders, I designed wireframes, built prototypes, and ensured that all parties were satisfied with the design and functionality.
