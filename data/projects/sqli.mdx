## Leading Design Excellence for Major Clients and Internal Growth

As the Lead Designer for a team of designers at this digital agency, it was my responsibility to ensure that the team was on the right track to designing high-quality apps for our major clients.

I also worked on internal projects, ensuring that our voice was represented and that our brand and design remained strong and visible.
