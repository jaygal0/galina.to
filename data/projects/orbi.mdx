## Main Responsibilities

I manage three different products (two web dashboards and one app), focusing on understanding the needs of key stakeholders, addressing major issues, and ensuring a smooth release for every new feature. I design prototypes, test ideas with users, and collaborate closely with engineers during every implementation. With over 130,000 users, there are naturally many pain points, but I work to reduce these issues and streamline user flows, creating a better overall experience.

_Below are a few screenshots of the products I have led in creating, which are now used by hundreds of thousands of users._

## Building a Consistent Design System

Overseeing the companyâ€™s brand redesign, I took the initiative to create a design system that ensured consistency across all of our products. By meticulously reviewing every component across both mobile and web platforms, I adhere to our brand guidelines and maintain consistency throughout.

_Below are a few screenshots of the intricate design system that I built from scratch._
