## Main Responsibilities

Managing three different products (two web dashboards and one app), I was primarily responsible for understanding the needs of key stakeholders, addressing major issues, and ensuring a smooth release for every new feature.

I designed prototypes, tested ideas with users, and collaborated closely with engineers during implementation.

With over 130,000 users, there were naturally many pain points, but it was my job to reduce these issues and streamline the user flows, creating a better overall experience.

## Design

Overseeing the companyâ€™s brand redesign, I took the initiative to create a design system that ensured consistency across all of our products. By meticulously reviewing every component across both mobile and web platforms, I adhered to our brand guidelines and maintained consistency throughout.

## Building the Roadmap

Working closely with the CEO, it was up to the team and me to build a roadmap that was both realistic and beneficial to our users. I was involved in every new feature and iteration, whether big or small.
