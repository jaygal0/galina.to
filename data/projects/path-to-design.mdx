## Personal Growth Through App Development and Networking

To enhance my skills, I took the initiative to design and build an app using a specific tech stack. Additionally, to expand my network of designers, I created a directory aimed at helping aspiring designers learn how to enter the industry.

This is an ongoing project that I continually iterate and develop. It has become a platform for me to experiment with both design and implementation, allowing me to further hone my skills.
