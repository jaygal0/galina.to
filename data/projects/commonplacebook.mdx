## Creating a Personal Knowledge Reminder App

Inspired by Ryan Holiday, I set out to build an app that would remind me of the book notes I had taken from the many books I read. From design to front-end development, and even building the back-end, I created a site that continues to provide value to me today.

If time allows, I plan to iterate and develop this idea further. Given how much value it has brought me, Iâ€™m confident it can benefit others as well.
