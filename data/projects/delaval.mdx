## Main Responsibilities

Working closely with the main stakeholders, it was my responsibility to address the key issues and collaborate with engineers to ensure a smooth release. I was also involved in creating wireframes, building prototypes, and defining design guidelines to maintain consistency across all platforms. With multiple products, both internal and external, I ensured brand consistency while delivering a great user experience.
