## Expanding a Leading Vegan Brand’s Digital Presence

As part of one of the largest and most subscribed Instagram accounts focused on veganism, I played a key role in growing the account’s following to over 100,000 followers. I was responsible for further expanding the brand and increasing its digital reach. Collaborating closely with major brands across the United Kingdom, the team and I achieved success across multiple platforms, contributing to the account’s strong presence in the vegan community.

_Below are a few designs I created specifically for our our pitch decks_
