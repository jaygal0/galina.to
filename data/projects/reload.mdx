## Building a Platform for Unsigned Artists on YouTube

Straight out of university, I knew I wanted to explore something relatively new at the time: YouTube. Fast-forward six years, and my business partner and I had built a substantial following and established a business in the music industry that championed unsigned artists.

With over 85,000 subscribers and 20 million views, we became the go-to platform for unsigned artists to showcase their skills and caught the attention of major players in the industry.

Working closely with major record labels, prominent brands, and filming in YouTube studios, I was able to grow as a professional, honing my craft and acquiring additional skills along the way.

_Below are a few examples of work I was able to create at my time with Reload_
