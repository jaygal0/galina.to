For the past 2 years I've tried to write a post on the day of my birthday to help me reflect on the past year, appreciate what I have achieved, and to help align my goals for my next birthday. 

The problem this year was that so much was going on around my birthday that I completely forgot to write an entry. Almost 2 weeks have passed and it's only now that I managed to sit down and write a post.

Better late than never.

As I write this post I'm currently sitting in a cafe in Osaka, Japan as I'm out here celebrating my honeymoon. 

I told you there was so much going on around my birthday, I wasn't kidding!

This year has been a year full of change. We got another dog, work has been going great, and we finally got married. 

## Married life

We tied the knot in front of my friends and family just a few weeks ago. It was almost a year of preparations and leading up to the big day I was looking forward to it all being over. 

When the day did come around I had a blast. I had told myself to enjoy the day and to appreciate everyone being there to celebrate the day with us. And I did exactly that. 

I had loads of fun. 

Although it was a little strange seeing people from different circles interacting with each other, it was really nice to see everyone mingling.

Married life feels the same as it did a few years ago. I've been with my partner for so long now that we were practically married. We just made it official in front of friends and family. 

## Priorities

As the wedding day drew closer and it was just a few months away, most of my spare time was spent on making sure that our wedding day went according to plan. Now that that day has passed, I'm looking forward to prioritising other things in my life that I had to put to the side because of time.

What do I plan on prioritising? 

Of course the usual. Be a great partner, my health, the dogs and etc... But if I'm being more specific, I would love to prioritise my Swedish again. Now that I have more time on my hands, I want to take this skill seriously again as I keep finding myself in awkward situations due to my lack of Swedish. 

I have no excuse now.

## Looking back
 
I enjoy writing these posts because I get to reflect on the year and realise that I have actually been developing in all aspects of my life. Often at times, I find myself too focused on what's ahead that I forget to look back and appreciate what I have acheived.

Which gets me thinking that I'd like to do posts like this more than just once a year. It doesn't have to be complicated, nor do I have to share it with the rest of the world, but it would be a good idea to figure out how I can do something like this more often.

## Moving forward

This year has seen its fair share of ups and downs, but as long as I appreciate the good and learn from the bad I can only be grateful that I have another opportunity to write another birthday post.
